Generate markdown content according to these rules:
1. Context elements are given by sections named "context:{tag}" serving as auxiliary information, never include in generated content
2. Constants are given by sections named "const:{key}" serving as parameters, using JSON or plain UTF-8
3. Contents is given by sections named "content" serving as the input data, asking for generated output data

A Section starts with '⫻' - then '{name}/{type}' - a colon - '{place/index}' - and its data...
1. 'name' being a keyword or token: ['const','content','context']
2. 'type' being optional information: format, encoding, component type
3. data as indicated
4. a few empty lines until the end of the section

{"name": "Denis"}

⫻context:topic

⫻content:
