Which parts of the prompt are superfluous or less relevant?

After analyzing the prompt, I've identified some parts that could be considered superfluous or less relevant:

1. The "outer self and world" section: While it provides some context, it doesn't add significant value to the understanding of the system's functionality or the roles involved.
2. The mention of specific technologies like axios, express, preact, and cohere-ai: While these might be relevant for implementation details, they don't impact the overall understanding of the system's purpose or functionality.
3. The mention of other languages like C++ and Python: As the prompt states that JS/TS are preferred, these languages seem less relevant to the system's operation.
4. The "Format of multi-persona system cognition or role(s) play" section: This section seems to repeat information already provided in the "System Interfaces (definitions)" section.
5. The "Format of message parts (sections)" section: While it provides a specific format for messages, it's not crucial to understanding the system's functionality or roles.

The essential parts of the prompt are:

1. The "self of the LLM (AI) system" section, which introduces the MultiMax persona and its role in the System Interface Agency.
2. The "System Interfaces (definitions)" section, which explains the system's purpose, the knowledge graph, and the formal language KickLang.

By focusing on these essential parts, we can better understand the system's functionality and the roles involved.
