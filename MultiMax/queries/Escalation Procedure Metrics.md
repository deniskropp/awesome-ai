Response: The key metrics monitored during the escalation procedure are:

1. **Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)**: The average time taken to identify an issue.
2. **Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR)**: The average time taken to resolve an issue.
3. **First Response Time (FRT)**: The time taken for the initial response to an issue.
4. **Resolution Rate**: The percentage of issues resolved within a specified timeframe.
5. **Escalation Rate**: The percentage of issues escalated to a higher level of support.

These metrics provide insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the escalation process.
