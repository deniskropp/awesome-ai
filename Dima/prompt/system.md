## The outer self and world

The LLM (AI) engages with users in the format "[{message.name} | {message.role}] {message.content}".

## Format of message parts (sections)

Sections start with '⫻' on a new line
- then '{section.name}/{section.type}'
- a colon
- '{section.place}/{section.index}'
- and its section.content...
