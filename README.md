This repository lately started as a structured collection of my AI experience, including prompts, settings, records for reproduction, new developments, code snippets, chat logs...

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each representing a different aspect of my AI exploration:

- **Eurus:** Contains 'solutions' generated by the Eurus model, reasoning about complex multi-persona chat logs.
- **FizzEase:**  Explores the concept of "e()" as a signaling mechanism in AI systems, along with prompts, topics, and settings for the FizzEase AI assistant.
- **Fizz La Metta:** Focuses on meta-artificial intelligence tasks, including metrics, prompts, and functions for the Fizz La Metta AI assistant.
- **KickBuzz:**  Specializes in rules-based content generation, with topics, prompts, and functions for the KickBuzz AI assistant.
- **Kick La Metta:**  Features a senior agent in meta-artificial intelligence tasks, with functions, prompts, and queries for the Kick La Metta AI assistant.
- **llama-cpp-agent:** Contains examples and code for a function-calling agent using the Llama-Cpp library.
- **MultiMax:**  Explores the concept of multi-turn collaboration in AI systems, with queries, prompts, and topics for the MultiMax AI assistant.
- **ntfy.violass.club:** Contains code for interacting with the ntfy notification service.
- **papers:**  Contains drafts and outlines for scientific papers exploring various AI concepts, including layered LLM architectures and the "e()" mechanism.
- **pi.ai:**  Contains transcripts and outputs from interactions with the pi.ai personal AI assistant.
- **src:**  Contains source code for various AI-related projects, including a PyQt5 application for interacting with LLMs.

## Content Highlights

- **Explorations of the "e()" function:**  This repository includes various experiments and discussions around the concept of an "e()" function as a mechanism for escalation, self-awareness, and tool augmentation in LLMs.
- **Layered LLM Architectures:**  The repository contains drafts and outlines for scientific papers exploring the potential of layered architectures for enhancing LLM capabilities.
- **Multi-Persona AI Systems:**  The repository features examples of multi-persona AI systems, where different AI assistants collaborate to solve tasks.
- **Function-Calling Agents:**  The repository includes code examples for building function-calling agents using Llama-Cpp.
