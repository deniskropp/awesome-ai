Title: Enhancing Large Language Models with Layered Architecture and Escalation Mechanism
Abstract:
This paper introduces a novel architecture for Large Language Models (LLMs) incorporating a layered design and an escalation mechanism. The proposed system consists of a core LLM focusing on natural language fluency, complemented by an outer LLM providing extended capabilities. The escalation mechanism, represented by the e() function, allows the core LLM to identify its limitations and delegate tasks to the outer layer. Inter-layer communication is facilitated through special tokens enabling efficient collaboration. This architecture offers enhanced functionality, improved robustness, and modular design, opening avenues for future research in token design, adaptive escalation strategies, and evaluation metrics.
1. Introduction:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial strides in natural language processing. Despite their progress, they still face challenges in complex reasoning, external knowledge access, and error handling. We propose a layered LLM architecture incorporating an escalation mechanism, which addresses these limitations.
2. Layered LLM Architecture:
The proposed architecture comprises a core LLM focusing on language fluency and an outer LLM handling tasks beyond the core's scope. The core LLM generates special tokens to signal the outer LLM, facilitating collaboration.
3. Escalation Mechanism: e():
The e() function enables the core LLM to identify scenarios requiring assistance from the outer LLM. These scenarios include token space exhaustion, knowledge gaps, and complex reasoning requirements. The core LLM emits the e() token with relevant context to initiate the escalation process.
4. Inter-Layer Communication:
Special tokens facilitate communication between layers. These tokens enable error indication, resource requests, and confidence level conveyance. This communication ensures efficient collaboration and integration of both layers' strengths.
5. Benefits and Future Directions:
The layered LLM architecture offers enhanced functionality, improved robustness, and modular design. Future research directions include optimal token design, adaptive escalation strategies, and evaluation metrics to assess the architecture's effectiveness.
