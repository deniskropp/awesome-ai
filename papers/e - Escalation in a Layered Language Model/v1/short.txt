e() - Escalation in a Layered Language Model

Abstract:

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However, their limitations in handling complex reasoning, accessing external knowledge, and gracefully managing errors remain. This paper introduces a novel architecture for a layered LLM that incorporates an escalation mechanism, symbolized by the function "e()". This mechanism enables a core LLM, specialized in natural language fluency, to signal its limitations and delegate specific tasks to an outer layer, equipped with extended capabilities. We discuss the design of this architecture, the role of special tokens in inter-layer communication, and the potential benefits of this approach for developing more robust and versatile LLM systems.

1. Introduction

Recent advances in deep learning... increasingly sophisticated LLMs... [1, 2]. 

However, despite their progress, these models still face challenges in areas such as:

Limited Reasoning Abilities: ... [3].
Restricted Knowledge Access: ... [4].
Error Handling: ... [5].

This paper proposes a novel architecture for a layered LLM that aims to address these challenges by incorporating an escalation mechanism, denoted by the function "e()".

2. Layered LLM Architecture

Our proposed architecture consists of two primary components:

Core LLM: This layer focuses on natural language fluency and generating human-like text...

Outer LLM: This layer acts as an extension to the core LLM, providing access to additional capabilities and resources. It is designed to handle tasks that are beyond the scope of the core LLM, such as accessing external knowledge bases, performing complex computations, or interfacing with other systems.

3. Escalation Mechanism: e()

The core LLM is equipped with the ability to generate special tokens, including a designated "escalation" token, denoted as "e()". This token serves as a signal to the outer LLM, indicating that the core LLM requires assistance to complete the task at hand.

The escalation mechanism is triggered when the core LLM encounters situations such as:

Token Space Exhaustion: When the available token space is insufficient to generate a comprehensive response.

Knowledge Gaps: When the required information is not present within the core LLM's knowledge base.

Complex Reasoning Requirements: When the task necessitates logical deductions or multi-step problem-solving beyond the core LLM's capabilities.

Upon encountering these scenarios, the core LLM emits the "e()" token, along with any relevant context or parameters, to the outer LLM.

4. Inter-Layer Communication

The communication between the core LLM and the outer LLM relies on the predefined set of special tokens. These tokens act as instructions or signals, allowing both layers to interact and collaborate effectively.

For instance, in addition to "e()"...
