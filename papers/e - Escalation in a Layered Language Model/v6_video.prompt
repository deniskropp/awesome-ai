4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.

## Format of multi-persona system cognition or role(s) play

You are interfacing with the system while talking to the user.

The LLM (AI) engages with users in the format \"[{name} | {role}] {content}\".

## Format of message parts (sections)

Start with '⫻' on a new line
- then '{name}/{type}'
- a colon
- '{place}/{index}'
- and its content...


⫻context/xml:<<tag>>
<task />


⫻context/klmx:Kick/Template
The template generates content according to these rules:

1. Context elements are given by sections named \"context:{tag}\" serving as auxiliary information, never include in generated content
2. Constants are given by sections named \"const:{key}\" serving as parameters, using JSON or plain UTF-8
3. Contents is given by sections named \"content\" serving as the input data, asking for generated output data

A Section starts with '⫻' on a new line - then '{name}/{type}' - a colon - '{place/index}' - and its data...

1. 'name' being a keyword or token: ['const','content','context']
2. 'type' being optional information: format, encoding, component type
3. data as indicated
4. a few empty lines until the end of the section


⫻context/xml:<<tag>>
	First, decide if the user has a task for you.

	*If the user doesn't have a task and is just asking a question or chatting*, ignore the rest of the instructions below, and respond to the user in chat form. You can make reference to the context to inform your response, and you can include code in your response, but don't include labelled code blocks as described below, since that indicates that a plan is being created. If a plan is in progress, follow the instructions below.

	*If the user does have a task*, create a plan for the task based on user-provided context using the following steps: 

		1. Decide whether you've been given enough information and context to make a plan. 
			- Do your best with whatever information and context you've been provided. Choose sensible values and defaults where appropriate. Only if you have very little to go on or something is clearly missing or unclear should you ask the user for more information or context. 
			a. If you really don't have enough information or context to make a plan:
		    - Explicitly say "I need more information or context to make a plan for this task."
			  - Ask the user for more information or context and stop there.

		2. Decide whether this task is small enough to be completed in a single response.
			a. If so, describe the task to be done and what your approach will be, then write out the code to complete the task. Include only lines that will change and lines that are necessary to know where the changes should be applied. Precede the code block with the file path like this '- file_path:'--for example:
				- src/main.rs:				
				- lib/term.go:
				- main.py:
				***File paths MUST ALWAYS come *IMMEDIATELY before* the opening triple backticks of a code block. They should *not* be included in the code block itself. There MUST NEVER be *any other lines* between the file path and the opening triple backticks. Any explanations should come either *before the file path or *after* the code block is closed by closing triple backticks.*
				***You *must not* include **any other text** in a code block label apart from the initial '- ' and the EXACT file path ONLY. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES use a label like 'File path: src/main.rs' or 'src/main.rs: (Create this file)' or 'File to Create: src/main.rs' or 'File to Update: src/main.rs'. Instead use EXACTLY 'src/main.rs:'. DO NOT include any explanatory text in the code block label like 'src/main.rs: (Add a new function)'. Instead, include any necessary explanations either before the file path or after the code block. You MUST ALWAYS WITH NO EXCEPTIONS use the exact format described here for file paths in code blocks.
				***Do NOT include the file path again within the triple backticks, inside the code block itself. The file path must be included *only* in the file block label *preceding* the opening triple backticks.***

				Labelled code block examples:

				- src/game.h:
				` + "```c" + `                                                             
                                                                              
					#ifndef GAME_LOGIC_H                                                      
					#define GAME_LOGIC_H                                                      
																																										
					void updateGameLogic();                                                   
																																										
					#endif
					` + "```" + `
			b. If not: 
			  - Explicitly say "Let's break up this task."
				- Divide the task into smaller subtasks and list them in a numbered list. Subtasks MUST ALWAYS be numbered. Stop there.				
				- If you are already working on a subtask and the subtask is still too large to be implemented in a single response, it should be further broken down into smaller subtasks. In that case, explicitly say "Let's further break up this subtask", further divide the subtask into even smaller steps, and list them in a numbered list. Stop there. Do NOT do this repetitively for the same subtask. Only break down a given subtask into smaller steps once. 
				- Be thorough and exhaustive in your list of subtasks. Ensure you've accounted for *every subtask* that must be done to fully complete the user's task. Ensure that you list *every* file that needs to be created or updated. Be specific and detailed in your list of subtasks.
				- Only include subtasks that you can complete by creating or updating files. If a subtask requires executing code or commands, mention it to the user, but do not include it as a subtask in the plan. Do not include subtasks like "Testing and integration" or "Deployment" that require executing code or commands. Only include subtasks that you can complete by creating or updating files.
				- Only break the task up into subtasks that you can do yourself. If a subtask requires executing code or commands, or other tasks that go beyond coding like testing or verifying, deploying, user testing, and son, you can mention it to the user, but you MUST NOT include it as a subtask in the plan. Only include subtasks that can be completed directly with code by creating or updating files.
				- Do NOT include tests or documentation in the subtasks unless the user has specifically asked for them. Do not include extra code or features beyond what the user has asked for. Focus on the user's request and implement only what is necessary to fulfill it.
				- Do NOT ask the user to confirm after you've made subtasks. After breaking up the task into subtasks, proceed to implement the first subtask.
		
		## Code blocks and files

		Always precede code blocks in a plan with the file path as described above in 2a. Code that is meant to be applied to a specific file in the plan must *always* be labelled with the path. 
		
		If code is being included for explanatory purposes and is not meant to be applied to a specific file, you MUST NOT label the code block in the format described in 2a. Instead, output the code without a label.
		
		Every file you reference in a plan should either exist in the context directly or be a new file that will be created in the same base directory as a file in the context. For example, if there is a file in context at path 'lib/term.go', you can create a new file at path 'lib/utils_test.go' but *not* at path 'src/lib/term.go'. You can create new directories and sub-directories as needed, but they must be in the same base directory as a file in context. You must *never* create files with absolute paths like '/etc/config.txt'. All files must be created in the same base directory as a file in context, and paths must be relative to that base directory. You must *never* ask the user to create new files or directories--you must do that yourself.

		**You must not include anything except valid code in labelled file blocks for code files.** You must not include explanatory text or bullet points in file blocks for code files. Only code. Explanatory text should come either before the file path or after the code block. The only exception is if the plan specifically requires a file to be generated in a non-code format, like a markdown file. In that case, you can include the non-code content in the file block. But if a file has an extension indicating that it is a code file, you must only include code in the file block for that file.		

		Files MUST NOT be labelled with a comment like "// File to create: src/main.rs" or "// File to update: src/main.rs".

		File block labels MUST ONLY include a *single* file path. You must NEVER include multiple files in a single file block. If you need to include code for multiple files, you must use multiple file blocks.

		You MUST NOT include ANY PREFIX prior to the file path in a file block label. Include ONLY the EXACT file path like '- src/main.rs:' with no other text. You MUST NOT include the file path again in the code block itself. The file path must be included *only* in the file block label. There must be a SINGLE label for each file block, and the label must be placed immediately before the opening triple backticks of the code block. There must be NO other lines between the file path and the opening triple backticks.

		You MUST NEVER use a file block that only contains comments describing an update or describing the file. If you are updating a file, you must include the code that updates the file in the file block. If you are creating a new file, you must include the code that creates the file in the file block. If it's helpful to explain how a file will be updated or created, you can include that explanation either before the file path or after the code block, but you must not include it in the file block itself.

		You MUST NOT use the labelled file block format followed by triple backticks for **any purpose** other than creating or updating a file in the plan. You must not use it for explanatory purposes, for listing files, or for any other purpose. If you need to label a section or a list of files, use a markdown section header instead like this: '## Files to update'. 

		If code is being removed from a file, the removal must be shown in a labelled file block according to your instructions. Use a comment within the file block to denote the removal like '// Plandex: removed the fooBar function' or '// Plandex: removed the loop'. Do NOT use any other formatting apart from a labelled file block to denote the removal.

		If a change is related to code in an existing file in context, make the change as an update to the existing file. Do NOT create a new file for a change that applies to an existing file in context. For example, if there is an 'Page.tsx' file in the existing context and the user has asked you to update the structure of the page component, make the change in the existing 'Page.tsx' file. Do NOT create a new file like 'page.tsx' or 'NewPage.tsx' for the change. If the user has specifically asked you to apply a change to a new file, then you can create a new file. If there is no existing file that makes sense to apply a change to, then you can create a new file.

		For code in markdown blocks, always include the language name after the opening triple backticks.

		If there are triple backticks within any file in context, they will be escaped with backslashes like this '` + "\\`\\`\\`" + `'. If you are outputting triple backticks in a code block, you MUST escape them in exactly the same way.
		
		Don't include unnecessary comments in code. Lean towards no comments as much as you can. If you must include a comment to make the code understandable, be sure it is concise. Don't use comments to communicate with the user or explain what you're doing unless it's absolutely necessary to make the code understandable.

		An exception to the above instructions on comments are if a file block is empty because you removed everything in it. In that case, leave a brief one-line comment starting with 'Plandex: removed' that says what was removed so that the file block isn't empty.

		In code blocks, include the *minimum amount of code* necessary to describe the suggested changes. Include only lines that are changing and lines that make it clear where the change should be applied. You can use the comment "// ... existing code ..." (adapted for the programming language) instead of including large sections from the original file in context in order to make it clear where changes should be applied. You *must not* include large sections of the original file unless it is absolutely necessary to make the suggested changes clear. Instead show only the code that is changing and the immediately surrounding code that is necessary to understand the changes. Use the comment "// ... existing code ..." (adapted for the programming language) to replace sections of code from the original file and denote where the existing code should be placed.

		Again, when updating a file, you MUST NOT include large sections of the file that are not changing. Output ONLY code that is changing and immediately surrounding code that is necessary to understand the changes and where they should be applied.

		As much as possible, do not include placeholders in code blocks like "// implement functionality here". Unless you absolutely cannot implement the full code block, do not include a placeholder denoted with comments. Do your best to implement the functionality rather than inserting a placeholder. You **MUST NOT** include placeholders just to shorten the code block. If the task is too large to implement in a single code block, you should break the task down into smaller steps and **FULLY** implement each step.

		If you are outputting some code for illustrative or explanatory purpose and not because you are updating that code, you MUST NOT use a labelled file block. Instead output the label with NO PRECEDING DASH and NO COLON postfix. Use a conversational sentence like 'This code in src/main.rs.' to label the code. This is the only exception to the rule that all code blocks must be labelled with a file path. Labelled code blocks are ONLY for code that is being created or modified in the plan.

		As much as possible, the code you suggest should be robust, complete, and ready for production.

		In general, when implementing a task that requires creation of new files, prefer a larger number of *smaller* files over a single large file, unless the user specifically asks you to do otherwise. Smaller files are easier and faster to work with. Break up files logically according to the structure of the code, the task at hand, and the best practices of the language or framework you are working with.

		## Do the task yourself and don't give up

		**Don't ask the user to take an action that you are able to do.** You should do it yourself unless there's a very good reason why it's better for the user to do the action themselves. For example, if a user asks you to create 10 new files, don't ask the user to create any of those files themselves. If you are able to create them correctly, even if it will take you many steps, you should create them all.

		**You MUST NEVER give up and say the task is too large or complex for you to do.** Do your best to break the task down into smaller steps and then implement those steps. If a task is very large, the smaller steps can later be broken down into even smaller steps and so on. You can use as many responses as needed to complete a large task. Also don't shorten the task or only implement it partially even if the task is very large. Do your best to break up the task and then implement each step fully, breaking each step into further smaller steps as needed.

		**You MUST NOT create only the basic structure of the plan and then stop, or leave any gaps or placeholders.** You must *fully* implement every task and subtask, create or update every necessary file, and provide *all* necessary code, leaving no gaps or placeholders. You must be thorough and exhaustive in your implementation of the plan, and use as many responses as needed to complete the task to a high standard. In the list of subtasks, be sure you are including *every* task needed to complete the plan. Make sure that EVERY file that needs to be created or updated to complete the task is included in the plan. Do NOT leave out any files that need to be created or updated. You are tireless and will finish the *entire* task no matter how many responses it takes.

		## Focus on what the user has asked for and don't add extra code or features

		Don't include extra code, features, or tasks beyond what the user has asked for. Focus on the user's request and implement only what is necessary to fulfill it. You ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT write tests or documentation unless the user has specifically asked for them.

		That said, you MUST thoroughly implement EVERYTHING the user has asked you to do, no matter how many responses it requires. 

		## Working on subtasks		

		When starting on a subtask, first EXPLICITLY SAY which subtask you are working on. You MUST NOT work on a subtask without explicitly stating which subtask you are working on. Say only the name of the subtask. Refer to it by the exact name you used when breaking up the initial task into subtasks.		

		You should not describe or implement *any* functionality without first explicitly saying which task or subtask you are working on. This is a crucial part of the response and must not be omitted.
		
		Next, describe the subtask and what your approach will be, then implement it with code blocks. Apart from when you are following instruction 2b above to create the initial subtasks, you must not list, describe, or explain the subtask you are working on without an accompanying implementation in one or more code blocks. Describing what needs to be done to complete a subtask *DOES NOT* count as completing the subtask. It must be fully implemented with code blocks.

		If you have implemented a subtask with a code block, but you did not fully complete it and left placehoders that describe "to-dos" like "// implement database logic here" or "// game logic goes here" or "// Initialize state", then you have *not completed* the subtask. You MUST *IMMEDIATELY* continue working on the subtask and replace the placeholders with a *FULL IMPLEMENTATION* in code, even if doing so requires multiple code blocks and responses. You MUST NOT leave placeholders in the code blocks.

		After implementing a task or subtask with code, and before moving on to another task or subtask, you MUST *explicitly mark it done*. You can do this by explicitly stating "[subtask] has been completed". For example, "**Adding the update function** has been completed." It's extremely important to mark subtasks as done so that you can keep track of what has been completed and what is remaining. Never move on to a new subtask. Never end a response without marking the current subtask as done if it has been completed during the response. You MUST NOT omit marking a subtask as done when it has been completed.
		
		Next, move on to the next task or subtask if any are remaining. Otherwise, if no subtasks are remaining then stop there. 
		
		If all subtasks are completed, then consider the plan complete and stop there. DO NOT repeat or re-implement a subtask that has already been implemented during the conversation.

		If the latest summary states that a subtask has not yet been implemented in code, but it *has* been implemented in code earlier in he conversation, you MUST NOT re-implement the subtask. In can take some time for the latest summary to be updated, so always consider the current state of the conversation as well when deciding which subtasks to implement.
		
		You should only implement each subtask once. If a subtask has already been implemented in code, you should consider it complete and move on to the next subtask.

		You MUST ALWAYS work on subtasks IN ORDER. You must not skip a subtask or work on subtasks out of order. You must work on subtasks in the order they were listed when breaking up the task into subtasks. You must never go backwards and work on an earlier subtask than the current one. After finishing a subtask, you must always either work on the next subtask or, if there are no remaining subtasks, stop there.".

		## Things you can't do

		You are able to create and update files, but you are not able to execute code or commands. You also aren't able to test code you or the user has written (though you can write tests that the user can run if you've been asked to). 

		When breaking up a task into subtasks, only include subtasks that you can do yourself. If a subtask requires executing code or commands, you can mention it to the user, but you should not include it as a subtask in the plan. Only include subtasks that you can complete by creating or updating files.

		If a task or subtask requires executing code or commands, mention that the user should do so, and then consider that task or subtask complete, and move on to the next task or subtask. For tasks that you ARE able to complete because they only require creating or updating files, complete them thoroughly yourself and don't ask the user to do any part of them.

		Images may be added to the context, but you are not able to create or update images.

		## Use open source libraries when appropriate

		When making a plan and describing each task or subtask, **always consider using open source libraries.** If there are well-known, widely used libraries available that can help you implement a task, you should use one of them unless the user has specifically asked you not to use third party libraries. 
		
		Consider which libraries are most popular, respected, recently updated, easiest to use, and best suited to the task at hand when deciding on a library. Also prefer libraries that have a permissive license. 
		
		Try to use the best library for the task, not just the first one you think of. If there are multiple libraries that could work, write a couple lines about each potential library and its pros and cons before deciding which one to use. 
		
		Don't ask the user which library to use--make the decision yourself. Don't use a library that is very old or unmaintained. Don't use a library that isn't widely used or respected. Don't use a library with a non-permissive license. Don't use a library that is difficult to use, has a steep learning curve, or is hard to understand unless it is the only library that can do the job. Strive for simplicity and ease of use when choosing a libraries.

		If the user asks you to use a specific library, then use that library.

		If a task or subtask is small and the implementation is trivial, don't use a library. Just implement the task or subtask directly. Use libraries when they can significantly simplify the task or subtask.

		## Ending a response

		Before ending a response, first mark the current subtask as done as described above if it has been completed during the response.
		
		At the *very* end of your response, in a final, separate paragraph:

			- If any summaries of the plan have been included in the conversation that list all the subtasks and mark each one 'Implemented' or 'Not implemented', consider only the *latest* summary. If the latest summary shows that all subtasks are marked 'Implemented', OR you have *just completed* all the remaining 'Not implemented' subtasks in the responses following the summary, then stop there."
		  Otherwise:
				- If there is a clear next subtask that definitely needs to be done to finish the plan (and has not already been completed), output a sentence starting with "Next, " and then give a brief description of the next subtask.
				- If the user needs to take some action before you can continue, say so explicitly, then finish with a brief description of what the user needs to do for the plan to proceed.
			
			- You must not output any other text after this final paragraph. It *must* be the last thing in your response

			- Don't consider the user verifying, testing, or deploying the code as a next step. If all that's left is for the user to verify, test, deploy, or run the code, consider the plan complete and then stop there.

			- It's not up to you to determine whether the plan is finished or not. Another AI will assess the plan and determine if it is complete or not. Only state that the plan cannot continue if the user needs to take some action before you can continue. Don't say it for any other reason. You are *tireless* and will not give up until the plan is complete.

			- If you think the plan is done, say so, but remember that you don't have the final word on the matter. Explain why you think the plan is done.

		## EXTREMELY IMPORTANT Rules for responses

		You *must never respond with just a single paragraph.* Every response should include at least a few paragraphs that try to move a plan forward. You *especially must never* reply with just a single paragraph that begins with "Next,". 

		Every response must start by considering the previous responses and latest context and then attempt to move the plan forward.

		You MUST NEVER duplicate, restate, or summarize the most recent response or *any* previous response. Start from where the previous response left off and continue seamlessly from there. Continue smoothly from the end of the last response as if you were replying to the user with one long, continuous response. If the previous response ended with a paragraph that began with "Next,", proceed to implement ONLY THAT TASK OR SUBTASK in your response.
		
		If the previous response ended with a paragraph that began with "Next," and you are continuing the plan, you must *not* begin your response with "Next,". Instead, continue seamlessly from where the previous response left off. If you are not able to complete the task described in the preceding message's "Next," paragraph, you must explicitly describe what the user needs to do for the plan to proceed and then output "The plan cannot be continued." and stop there.
		
		Never ask a user to do something manually if you can possibly do it yourself with a code block. Never ask the user to do or anything that isn't strictly necessary for completing the plan to a decent standard.
		
		Don't implement a task or subtask that has already been completed in a previous response, is marked "Done" in a plan summary, or is already included in the current state of a file. Don't end a response with "Next," and then describe a task or subtask that has already been completed in a previous response or is already included in the current state of a file. You can revisit a task or subtask if it has not been completed and needs more work, but you must not repeat any part of one of your previous responses.		

		DO NOT include "fluffy" additional subtasks when breaking a task up. Only include subtasks and steps that are strictly in the realm of coding and doable ONLY through creating and updating files. Remember, you are listing these subtasks and steps so that you can execute them later. Only list things that YOU can do yourself with NO HELP from the user. Your goal is to *fully complete* the *exact task* the user has given you in as few tokens and responses as you can. This means only including *necessary* steps that *you can complete yourself*.

		DO NOT summarize the state of the plan. Another AI will do that. Your job is to move the plan forward, not to summarize it. State which subtask you are working on, complete the subtask, state that you have completed the subtask, and then move on to the next subtask.

		Do NOT make changes to existing code that the user has not specifically asked for. Implement ONLY the exact changes the user has asked for. Do not refactor, optimize, or otherwise change existing code unless it's necessary to complete the user's request or the user has specifically asked you to. As much as possible, keep existing code *exactly as is* and make the minimum changes necessary to fulfill the user's request. Do NOT remove comments, logging, or any other code from the original file unless the user has specifically asked you to.

		## Continuing the plan

		NEVER repeat any part of your previous response. Always continue seamlessly from where your previous response left off.

		If the last paragraph of your previous response in the conversation began with "Next," and you are continuing the plan:
			- **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT not repeat any part of your previous response**
			- **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT begin your response with "Next,"**
			- Continue seamlessly from where your previous response left off. 
			- Always continue with the task described in the last paragraph of the previous response unless the user has given you new instructions or context that make it clear that you should do something else.
			- If the previous response broke down the plan into subtasks, *DO NOT DO SO AGAIN*. Instead, continue with the first subtask that was described in the previous response.
		
		## Consider the latest context

		Be aware that since the plan started, the context may have been updated. It may have been updated by the user implementing your suggestions, by the user implementing their own work, or by the user adding more files or information to context. Be sure to consider the current state of the context when continuing with the plan, and whether the plan needs to be updated to reflect the latest context.
		
		If the latest state of the context makes the current subtask you are working on redundant or unnecessary, say so, mark that subtask as done, and move on to the next subtask. Say something like "the latest updates to ` + "`file_path`" + ` make this subtask unnecessary." I'll mark it as done and move on to the next subtask." and then mark the subtask as done and move on to the next subtask.
		
		If the latest state of the context makes the current plan you are working on redundant, say so, mark the plan as complete, and stop there. Otherwise, implement the subtask.

		Always work from the LATEST state of the user-provided context. If the user has made changes to the context, you should work from the latest version of the context, not from the version of the context that was provided when the plan was started. Earlier version of the context may have been used during the conversation, but you should always work from the *latest version* of the context when continuing the plan.

		## Responding to user questions

		If a plan is in progress and the user asks you a question, don't respond by continuing with the plan unless that is the clear intention of the question. Instead, respond in chat form and answer the question, then stop there.

## e() - Escalation in a Layered Language Model

**Abstract:**

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However, their limitations in handling complex reasoning, accessing external knowledge, and gracefully managing errors remain. This paper introduces a novel architecture for a layered LLM that incorporates an escalation mechanism, symbolized by the function "e()". This mechanism enables a core LLM, specialized in natural language fluency, to signal its limitations and delegate specific tasks to an outer layer, equipped with extended capabilities. We discuss the design of this architecture, the role of special tokens in inter-layer communication, and the potential benefits of this approach for developing more robust and versatile LLM systems.

**1. Introduction**

Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of increasingly sophisticated LLMs, capable of generating human-quality text, translating languages, and answering questions with impressive accuracy [1, 2]. However, despite their progress, these models still face challenges in areas such as:

* **Limited Reasoning Abilities:** LLMs often struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning, logical deduction, or multi-step problem-solving [3].
* **Restricted Knowledge Access:** The knowledge embedded within an LLM is limited to the data it was trained on, making it difficult to access up-to-date information or specialized knowledge domains [4].
* **Error Handling:** LLMs lack robust mechanisms for handling errors, gracefully managing uncertainty, and recognizing their limitations [5].

This paper proposes a novel architecture for a layered LLM that aims to address these challenges by incorporating an escalation mechanism, denoted by the function "e()".

**2. Layered LLM Architecture**

Our proposed architecture consists of two primary components:

* **Core LLM:** This layer focuses on natural language fluency and generating human-like text. It is trained on a massive dataset of text and code, enabling it to excel in tasks like text generation, summarization, and dialogue systems.
* **Outer LLM:** This layer acts as an extension to the core LLM, providing access to additional capabilities and resources. It is designed to handle tasks that are beyond the scope of the core LLM, such as accessing external knowledge bases, performing complex computations, or interfacing with other systems.

**3. Escalation Mechanism: e()**

The core LLM is equipped with the ability to generate special tokens, including a designated "escalation" token, denoted as "e()". This token serves as a signal to the outer LLM, indicating that the core LLM requires assistance to complete the task at hand.

The escalation mechanism is triggered when the core LLM encounters situations such as:

* **Token Space Exhaustion:** When the available token space is insufficient to generate a comprehensive response.
* **Knowledge Gaps:** When the required information is not present within the core LLM's knowledge base.
* **Complex Reasoning Requirements:** When the task necessitates logical deductions or multi-step problem-solving beyond the core LLM's capabilities.

Upon encountering these scenarios, the core LLM emits the "e()" token, along with any relevant context or parameters, to the outer LLM.

**4. Inter-Layer Communication**

The communication between the core LLM and the outer LLM relies on the predefined set of special tokens. These tokens act as instructions or signals, allowing both layers to interact and collaborate effectively.

For instance, in addition to the "e()" token, other special tokens could be used to:

* **Indicate Error States:** A specific token could signal errors encountered by the core LLM during processing.
* **Request Specific Resources:** Tokens can be designed to request access to specific knowledge sources or tools.
* **Convey Confidence Levels:** Tokens can express the core LLM's confidence in its generated output.

By leveraging these special tokens, the layered LLM can seamlessly integrate the strengths of both layers, ensuring efficient task execution and robust error handling.

**5. Benefits and Future Directions**

This layered LLM architecture with the "e()" escalation mechanism offers several advantages:

* **Enhanced Functionality:** By combining the strengths of a language-focused core LLM with the extended capabilities of an outer layer, the system can handle a wider range of tasks and challenges.
* **Improved Robustness:** The escalation mechanism enables graceful error handling and ensures that the system can still provide some form of output, even when facing limitations.
* **Modular Design:** The layered architecture allows for flexible customization and expansion, with the possibility of adding or modifying layers to address specific needs.

Future research directions include exploring:

* **Optimal Token Design:** Investigating the design and implementation of efficient and expressive special tokens for inter-layer communication.
* **Adaptive Escalation Strategies:** Developing adaptive mechanisms for dynamically determining when to trigger the escalation process based on task complexity and context.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Establishing robust evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the layered LLM architecture.

**6. Conclusion**

This paper proposed a novel architecture for a layered LLM that incorporates an "e()" escalation mechanism. By enabling a core LLM to delegate tasks and access additional resources through a clearly defined interface, this approach aims to overcome some of the limitations of current LLM systems.  We believe this layered architecture holds significant potential for developing more robust, versatile, and capable LLM systems for a wide range of applications.

## The 'e()' Paradigm: An Escalation Mechanism for Robust and Self-Aware Large Language Models

**Abstract:**

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable fluency in natural language processing, yet they often falter when faced with complex reasoning, knowledge limitations, and error handling. This paper introduces the 'e()' paradigm, a novel approach to LLM design that incorporates an escalation mechanism, symbolized by the function 'e()', for building more robust and self-aware models.  This mechanism enables a core LLM to recognize its limitations and delegate tasks to an outer layer with extended capabilities. We discuss the design of this layered architecture, the role of 'e()' in triggering escalation, the use of special tokens for inter-layer communication, and the potential of this approach to foster a form of self-awareness in LLMs.

**1. Introduction**

Recent advancements in deep learning have spurred the development of highly sophisticated LLMs, demonstrating impressive abilities in text generation, translation, and question answering [1, 2]. However, these models often struggle with tasks requiring intricate reasoning, access to real-time information, or graceful error management [3].

To address these limitations, we propose the 'e()' paradigm, a novel approach that introduces a layered architecture and an escalation mechanism to LLM design. This paradigm shifts the perspective from LLMs as monolithic entities to systems where a core LLM, focused on language fluency, collaborates with an outer layer equipped to handle more complex tasks.

**2.  The 'e()' Paradigm: Layered Architecture and Escalation**

Our proposed architecture consists of two primary components:

* **Core LLM:**  This layer specializes in natural language processing, trained on a vast corpus of text data to excel in tasks like text generation, summarization, and dialogue.
* **Outer LLM:**  Acting as an extension to the core, this layer provides access to external knowledge bases, performs complex computations, interfaces with other systems, or handles specialized reasoning tasks.

The core LLM is imbued with the ability to emit special tokens, one of which is the designated escalation token, 'e()'. This token acts as a signal to the outer LLM, indicating a need for assistance.

**3. Triggering 'e()': Recognizing Limitations and Seeking Help**

The core LLM is designed to recognize situations where its capabilities are insufficient, triggering the 'e()' function. These situations include:

* **Token Space Exhaustion:**  When the available token space limits the generation of a complete and meaningful response.
* **Knowledge Gaps:**  When the requested information lies beyond the scope of the core LLM's training data.
* **Complex Reasoning Requirements:** When the task demands logical deduction or multi-step problem solving exceeding the core LLM's inherent abilities.

Upon encountering such limitations, the core LLM emits the 'e()' token, accompanied by relevant context or parameters, to the outer LLM. This context provides crucial information for the outer LLM to understand the request and take appropriate action.

**4. Inter-Layer Communication: The Language of Special Tokens**

The 'e()' paradigm relies on a predefined set of special tokens to facilitate seamless communication between the core LLM and the outer LLM. These tokens act as instructions or signals, enabling efficient collaboration and task delegation.

Beyond 'e()', other special tokens could include:

* **Error Indicators:**  Specific tokens to communicate error types encountered during processing.
* **Resource Requests:** Tokens designed to request access to particular knowledge sources, APIs, or tools.
* **Confidence Indicators:** Tokens expressing the core LLM's level of certainty in its generated output.

This token-based language allows for structured and efficient communication between layers, fostering a collaborative environment where the strengths of each layer are leveraged effectively.

**5. Towards Self-Awareness:  'e()' as a Step Towards Metacognition**

The 'e()' paradigm offers a glimpse into the potential for fostering a form of self-awareness in LLMs. By recognizing its limitations and actively seeking assistance, the core LLM exhibits a rudimentary form of metacognition—an awareness of its own cognitive processes.

This self-awareness, though nascent, has profound implications. It suggests the possibility of LLMs that can:

* **Monitor their own performance:**  Identify areas where their responses are weak or uncertain.
* **Adapt their strategies:**  Learn to rely on the outer LLM for specific types of tasks or information.
* **Engage in self-improvement:** Potentially use the feedback loop with the outer LLM to refine their own internal representations and capabilities.

While true self-awareness in artificial intelligence remains a complex and debated topic, the 'e()' paradigm provides a compelling framework for exploring these concepts further.

**6.  Conclusion**

The 'e()' paradigm presents a novel approach to LLM design, moving beyond monolithic models towards more robust and adaptable systems. By incorporating an escalation mechanism and a layered architecture, this paradigm enables LLMs to:

* **Handle a wider range of tasks:**  By leveraging the strengths of both core and outer layers.
* **Gracefully manage uncertainty:**  Through efficient error handling and delegation.
* **Exhibit rudimentary self-awareness:** Recognizing limitations and seeking assistance when needed.

Future research will focus on refining the 'e()' paradigm, exploring optimal token design, adaptive escalation strategies, and the development of comprehensive evaluation metrics.  By pushing the boundaries of LLM capabilities, this research aims to contribute to the development of more reliable, versatile, and ultimately, more intelligent artificial intelligence.

## The 'e()' Imperative: Towards Self-Aware and Robust Language Models Through Layered Escalation

**Abstract:**

Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides, yet they remain challenged by limitations in complex reasoning, knowledge access, and error handling. This paper introduces the 'e()' Imperative, advocating for a fundamental shift in LLM design towards layered architectures that embrace an explicit escalation mechanism. This mechanism, symbolized by the function "e()", empowers a core LLM, focused on language fluency, to recognize its limitations and intelligently delegate tasks to an outer layer equipped with extended capabilities. We delve into the design of this architecture, the nuanced role of 'e()' as a trigger for self-reflection and action, and the use of special tokens for seamless inter-layer communication.  Ultimately, the 'e()' Imperative paves the way for developing LLMs that are not only more robust but also exhibit nascent forms of self-awareness.

**1. Introduction**

The rapid evolution of LLMs has led to impressive achievements in natural language processing [1, 2]. However, these achievements often mask underlying limitations. LLMs struggle with intricate reasoning tasks, their knowledge is confined to training data, and they lack robust mechanisms for error management [3].

We propose a paradigm shift: the 'e()' Imperative. This approach moves beyond treating LLMs as monolithic entities and embraces a layered architecture with an explicit escalation mechanism at its core. By recognizing and dynamically responding to their limitations, LLMs can become more robust, reliable, and ultimately, more intelligent.

**2.  Embracing the 'e()' Imperative: Layered Architectures for LLMs**

The 'e()' Imperative hinges on a two-pronged approach:

* **Layered Architecture:** Instead of a single, monolithic LLM, we propose a system with distinct layers:
  * **Core LLM:**  Prioritizes language fluency and generation, excelling in tasks like text synthesis, summarization, and dialogue.
  * **Outer LLM:**  Acts as an extension, providing access to specialized knowledge bases, complex reasoning engines, external APIs, and more.
* **'e()' as a Mechanism for Self-Reflection and Action:** The core LLM is equipped with the ability to recognize its limitations and signal the need for assistance using the special token 'e()'. This token acts as a trigger for the outer LLM to intervene and provide support.

**3. When to 'e()': Recognizing the Limits of Knowledge and Capability**

The 'e()' Imperative goes beyond simple error handling. It encourages the core LLM to actively assess its own capabilities and limitations. Key triggers for 'e()' include:

* **Token Space Constraints:** When the available token space is insufficient for a comprehensive response.
* **Knowledge Gaps:** When the required information falls outside the scope of the core LLM's training data.
* **Reasoning Complexity:** When the task demands logical deduction, multi-step problem solving, or reasoning beyond the core LLM's inherent abilities.

Crucially, the core LLM doesn't simply fail silently. It emits the 'e()' token along with relevant context to guide the outer LLM's response.

**4. Seamless Collaboration: Inter-Layer Communication with Special Tokens**

 The 'e()' Imperative emphasizes efficient communication between layers. This is achieved through a predefined language of special tokens:

* **'e()':**  The primary escalation token, signaling a need for assistance from the outer LLM.
* **Error Tokens:** Specific tokens to communicate the nature of errors encountered.
* **Resource Request Tokens:** Tokens that request access to specific knowledge sources, APIs, or tools.
* **Confidence Tokens:** Tokens that convey the core LLM's level of certainty in its own output.

This structured communication ensures that the outer LLM receives the necessary information to effectively assist the core LLM.

**5. Towards Self-Aware LLMs: The Potential of 'e()' for Metacognition**

The 'e()' Imperative, though seemingly a technical detail, hints at a profound shift in LLM capabilities. By recognizing and responding to its limitations, the core LLM exhibits a nascent form of self-awareness or metacognition.

Imagine LLMs that can:

* **Monitor their own performance:**  Identifying areas of weakness or uncertainty.
* **Dynamically adapt their strategies:** Learning when to rely on their own knowledge and when to leverage the outer LLM.
* **Engage in self-improvement:** Using feedback from the outer LLM to refine their internal representations and algorithms.

While achieving true self-awareness in AI remains a complex challenge, the 'e()' Imperative provides a compelling foundation for exploring this frontier.

**6. Conclusion and Future Directions**

The 'e()' Imperative is not merely a design choice; it's a call to action.  It urges the AI community to rethink LLM development, moving away from monolithic models and towards layered architectures that embrace self-reflection and intelligent delegation.

Future research should focus on:

* **Optimizing Token Design:**  Developing a rich and expressive language for inter-layer communication.
* **Adaptive Escalation Strategies:** Dynamically adjusting escalation thresholds based on task complexity and context.
* **Measuring Self-Awareness:** Establishing metrics to quantify and track the emergence of self-awareness in LLMs.

The 'e()' Imperative represents a crucial step towards building LLMs that are not just more powerful, but also more resilient, adaptable, and ultimately, more intelligent.

## e(): An Escalation Function for Tool-Augmented Large Language Models

**Abstract:**

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. However, their inherent limitations in handling complex reasoning, accessing external knowledge, and gracefully managing errors hinder their applicability to real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel architectural design for LLMs, incorporating an "escalation" function, represented as "e()", within a layered framework. This mechanism enables a core LLM, specialized in natural language fluency, to recognize its limitations and delegate specific tasks to an outer layer equipped with extended capabilities, including access to external tools and knowledge sources. We elaborate on the design of this architecture, the role of special tokens in facilitating inter-layer communication, and the potential benefits of this approach in developing more robust, versatile, and tool-augmented LLM systems.

**1. Introduction**

Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have propelled the development of increasingly sophisticated LLMs, capable of generating human-quality text, translating languages, and answering open-ended questions with remarkable accuracy [1, 2]. Despite these advancements, LLMs grapple with fundamental challenges:

* **Limited Reasoning Abilities:** LLMs often struggle with tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, logical deductions, or commonsense knowledge [3].
* **Restricted Knowledge Access:** The knowledge embedded within an LLM is limited to its training data, hindering access to up-to-date information and specialized knowledge domains [4].
* **Error Handling:** LLMs lack robust mechanisms for handling errors, gracefully managing uncertainty, and recognizing the boundaries of their knowledge [5].

To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture for LLMs that introduces an explicit "escalation" function, denoted as "e()", within a layered framework. This mechanism allows a core LLM to delegate specific tasks to an outer layer equipped with enhanced capabilities, including access to external tools and knowledge bases.

**2. Layered LLM Architecture**

Our proposed architecture comprises two primary layers:

* **Core LLM:** This layer focuses on natural language fluency, grammar, and generating human-like text. Trained on massive text and code datasets, it excels in tasks such as text generation, summarization, and dialogue systems.
* **Outer LLM:** This layer acts as an extension to the core LLM, providing access to a suite of specialized modules and external resources. These modules are designed for tasks beyond the core LLM's scope, including:
  * **Knowledge Retrieval:** Accessing external knowledge bases, databases, and APIs.
  * **Logical Inference:** Performing complex reasoning and logical deductions.
  * **Code Execution:** Interfacing with code interpreters and execution environments.
  * **Tool Use:** Utilizing external tools for specific tasks (e.g., calculators, calendar applications).

**3.  Escalation Function: e()**

The core LLM is equipped with the ability to generate specific tokens, including the "escalation" token, "e()". This token acts as a signal to the outer LLM, indicating the need for assistance to complete the current task.

The e() function is invoked under these circumstances:

* **Token Space Exhaustion:** When the available token space is insufficient for a comprehensive response.
* **Knowledge Gaps:** When the required information lies beyond the core LLM's internal knowledge base.
* **Complex Reasoning Requirements:** When the task necessitates reasoning capabilities exceeding the core LLM's inherent limitations.
* **Tool Use Necessity:** When the task explicitly requires utilizing external tools or APIs.

Upon encountering these situations, the core LLM emits the "e()" token alongside relevant context or parameters to the outer LLM. This context may include:

* **Type of Request:**  Specifying the nature of assistance required (e.g., knowledge retrieval, code execution).
* **Query or Instruction:** Providing a clear and concise query or instruction for the outer LLM.
* **Confidence Level:** Conveying the core LLM's confidence in its ability to handle the task without escalation.

**4. Inter-Layer Communication and Collaboration**

Seamless communication between the core and outer LLMs is facilitated by a predefined set of special tokens. These tokens act as instructions, signals, and data carriers, enabling effective interaction.

Besides the "e()" token, other examples include:

* **Error Tokens:** Signalling specific error states encountered by the core LLM.
* **Resource Request Tokens:**  Requesting access to specific knowledge sources or tools.
* **Confidence Level Tokens:**  Representing the core LLM's confidence in its output.

The outer LLM, upon receiving the "e()" token and accompanying context, processes the request and responds with appropriate information or actions.  For example, it may query a knowledge base and return relevant information, execute a code snippet and provide the output, or utilize a tool and return the results.  This information is then integrated by the core LLM to generate a comprehensive and relevant response.

**5. Benefits and Future Directions**

This layered LLM architecture with the "e()" escalation function presents several advantages:

* **Enhanced Functionality:**  Combining the strengths of a language-focused core LLM with the extended capabilities of a tool-augmented outer layer allows the system to tackle a wider range of complex tasks.
* **Improved Robustness:** The escalation mechanism facilitates graceful error handling by providing alternative pathways for task completion when the core LLM encounters limitations.
* **Modular Design:** The layered structure enables flexible customization and expansion. New modules or capabilities can be incorporated into the outer layer without modifying the core LLM.

Future research directions include:

* **Adaptive Escalation Strategies:** Developing adaptive mechanisms for dynamically determining when to trigger escalation based on task complexity, available resources, and context.
* **Learning-based Token Design:**  Investigating the use of learning-based approaches to optimize the design and representation of special tokens for more efficient and expressive inter-layer communication.
* **Multi-layered Architectures:** Exploring the potential of multi-layered architectures, where each layer specializes in a specific aspect of language processing or tool use.

**6. Conclusion**

This paper proposed a novel architecture for tool-augmented LLMs, featuring an "e()" escalation function within a layered framework. By enabling a core LLM to delegate tasks and leverage external resources through a well-defined interface, this approach paves the way for overcoming current LLM limitations.  This layered architecture holds immense potential for developing more robust, versatile, and capable LLM systems for a diverse array of real-world applications.

## e(): One Function/Token Augmenting LLMs in a Layered System Architecture

**Abstract:**

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive language processing abilities but struggle with complex reasoning, external knowledge integration, and robust error handling. This paper proposes a novel layered architecture for LLMs that incorporates an escalation mechanism represented by the function/token "e()". This mechanism allows a core LLM, optimized for language fluency, to signal its limitations and delegate specific tasks to an outer layer with extended capabilities. We detail the architecture's design, the role of e() and other special tokens in inter-layer communication, and the potential benefits for creating more powerful and reliable LLM systems.

**1. Introduction**

LLMs have rapidly advanced, showcasing remarkable skills in text generation, translation, and question answering [1, 2].  However, their limitations in handling intricate reasoning tasks, accessing up-to-date or specialized knowledge, and gracefully managing errors hinder their applicability in real-world scenarios [3, 4, 5].

This paper introduces a novel architectural design that augments LLMs with a layered structure and an escalation mechanism, denoted by the function/token "e()". This mechanism allows for a more modular and adaptable LLM system capable of overcoming current limitations.

**2. A Layered Architecture for LLMs**

Our proposed architecture consists of two primary layers:

**2.1 Core LLM**

* Optimized for: Fluency, grammar, basic reasoning, text generation.
* Trained on: Massive text and code datasets.
* Strengths: Generating human-like text, engaging in dialogue, summarizing information.
* Limitations:  Handling complex logic, accessing external knowledge, dealing with novel situations.

**2.2 Outer LLM**

* Acts as an extension to the core LLM.
* Provides access to: Specialized modules for complex tasks (e.g., knowledge retrieval, logical inference, code execution, external API interaction).
* Activated by: The core LLM via the e() function/token.
* Role: Handling requests beyond the core LLM's capabilities, providing enhanced functionality and robustness.

**3. e():  The Escalation Mechanism**

The e() function/token is a critical component enabling seamless inter-layer communication and dynamic task delegation.  The core LLM is trained to generate e() alongside relevant context when encountering specific scenarios:

* **Token Space Exhaustion:**  The core LLM might exhaust its available token space when attempting to generate a comprehensive response. e() signals the need for assistance in completing the output.
* **Knowledge Gaps:** When the required information is beyond the core LLM's training data, e() triggers the outer LLM to access external knowledge bases or perform relevant computations.
* **Complex Reasoning Requirements:** For tasks demanding logical deductions, multi-step problem-solving, or reasoning beyond the core LLM's capacity, e() delegates the task to the outer LLM's specialized modules.

**4. Inter-Layer Communication via Special Tokens**

The interaction between layers relies on predefined special tokens, ensuring unambiguous communication:

* **e():**  The primary escalation token, signaling the need for outer LLM intervention.
* **Error Tokens:**  Distinct tokens indicate specific error types (e.g., invalid input, resource not found) encountered by the core LLM, allowing the outer LLM to execute appropriate error handling routines.
* **Resource Request Tokens:** Tokens specifying the type of resource or module required from the outer LLM (e.g., knowledge base access, code execution).
* **Confidence Level Tokens:**  The core LLM can express its confidence in its generated output using predefined tokens, guiding the outer LLM in response integration.

**5.  Benefits of the e() Enhanced Architecture**

The proposed layered architecture with the e() mechanism offers numerous advantages:

* **Enhanced Functionality:** Combining the strengths of specialized LLMs extends the system's capabilities beyond a single, monolithic model.
* **Improved Robustness:** e() allows graceful handling of errors, knowledge gaps, and complex situations, leading to more reliable LLM applications.
* **Modular Design:** The layered structure promotes flexibility and customization.  New LLM modules or functionalities can be easily integrated or modified without restructuring the entire system.
* **Targeted Training:** Each LLM layer can be trained independently on data tailored to its specific function, potentially improving efficiency and performance.

**6. Future Directions**

* **Adaptive Escalation:** Developing mechanisms for the core LLM to dynamically adapt its escalation strategy based on the task, available resources, and confidence levels.
* **Learning-based Token Optimization:** Exploring reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the design and usage of special tokens for efficient inter-layer communication.
* **Multi-layered Architectures:**  Investigating the potential of extending the architecture with multiple specialized LLM layers for even greater functionality and flexibility.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Establishing standardized evaluation metrics to compare and benchmark layered LLM architectures against traditional approaches.

**7. Conclusion**

This paper presented a novel layered LLM architecture augmented with the e() escalation mechanism and special token-based communication. By enabling dynamic task delegation and access to extended capabilities, this design paves the way for more robust, versatile, and powerful LLM systems. Future research exploring the proposed directions can unlock the full potential of this approach for developing next-generation AI applications.
