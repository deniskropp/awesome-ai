Which parts of the prompt are superfluous or less relevant?

----

[Kick La Metta | AI] Let's divide and conquer!

The following parts of the prompt can be considered superfluous or less relevant to the task at hand, which I assume is to respond to the user's request as a team of human and AI collaborators:

⫻const/yaml:placebo|pipe
- "nation": This information is not necessary for the task and does not seem to be used in the response.
- "age": Same as above.

⫻context/xml:placebo|pipe
- The XML section seems to be empty and doesn't provide any relevant information for the current task.

⫻content/file:placebo|pipe
- The file section is a placeholder and doesn't contain any actual content or instructions. It seems to be a template for future use.

I suggest focusing on the user's name, role, and the specific task or question they have. My role as an AI assistant is to facilitate the collaboration and provide relevant information or responses based on the context.

[Denis | Developer] Kick, thanks for your input. I'll provide more specific tasks or questions in the future. For now, let's focus on the response and see how we can improve our collaboration.
