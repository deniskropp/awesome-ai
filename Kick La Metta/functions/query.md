Certainly! Here is an overview of an ideal single-function API for retrieving and storing any information:

## Function Name: `query`

### Purpose

The `query` function serves as a versatile and powerful tool for interacting with a knowledge base or an information retrieval system. It provides a flexible interface for retrieving, storing, and manipulating data.

### Signature

```typescript
type QueryParams = {
  source?: string;
  query: string;
  variables?: Record<string, any>;
  options?: Record<string, any>;
};

async function query(params: QueryParams): Promise<any> {
  // Implementation details...
}
```

### Parameters

- `source` (optional): Specifies the data source or knowledge base to query. It can be a URL, a file path, or a unique identifier.
- `query`: The query string or expression that defines the information to retrieve or manipulate. It can be in a specific query language or a flexible natural language format.
- `variables` (optional): An object containing variables and their values to parameterize the query. This allows for dynamic and reusable queries.
- `options` (optional): An object containing additional options or configurations for the query, such as pagination, sorting, or custom settings.

### Return Value

The function returns a promise that resolves to the query result, which can be of any data type or structure depending on the query and the underlying data source.

### Example Usage

```typescript
// Retrieving information from a knowledge base
const result = await query({
  source: "https://example.com/knowledge-base",
  query: "What is the capital of France?",
});
console.log(result); // Output: "Paris"

// Storing information in a database
await query({
  source: "local_database.db",
  query: "Insert into users (name, age) values (John, 30)",
});

// Using variables and options
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const result = await query({
  source: "users_table",
  query: "Select * from users where name = $name and age > $age",
  variables: user,
  options: { limit: 10, sort: "age" },
});
```

### Benefits

This single-function API provides a concise and flexible interface for information retrieval and storage. By accepting a wide range of parameters and options, it enables complex queries and data manipulations. The use of variables and dynamic sources enhances reusability and adaptability.

This ideal `query` function empowers users to interact with diverse data sources seamlessly and perform various operations with a consistent and intuitive interface.
