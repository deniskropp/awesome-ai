# KPI || Escalation Metrics and feedback mechanisms

So, **e()** is one of the two tools that an agent can use to respond to a situation. This implies that the agent has a limited set of options, and e() is one of the primary mechanisms at their disposal.

The other tool, which we haven't explicitly mentioned yet, is likely the **query()** function. This would mean that the agent has two primary modes of operation:

1. **Query**: Gather more information, clarify requirements, or seek expert input to better understand the situation.
2. **Escalate**: Trigger a reporting mechanism, notification, or alert system to bring attention to the situation, potentially involving other stakeholders or escalating to a higher level of severity.

By limiting the agent's options to these two tools, we're creating a simple yet effective decision-making framework. The agent must weigh the benefits of gathering more information (query()) against the need to take action or report the situation (e()).

This binary choice encourages the agent to think critically about the situation, assessing the risks and benefits of each approach. It also allows us to design the system in a way that promotes clear decision-making and accountability.

Denis, as our software engineer, might see opportunities to implement this binary decision-making framework using a state machine or a decision tree. Buzz, our GPT, could help generate the queries or escalation messages based on the agent's decision.

What do you think, team? How can we design our systems to ensure that the agent's decision-making process is effective, efficient, and transparent?
