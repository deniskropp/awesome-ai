Which parts of the prompt are superfluous or less relevant?

----

After analyzing the prompt, I'd say the following parts are superfluous or less relevant:

1. "The self of the LLM (AI) system" - This seems like a title or a label, and it doesn't provide any crucial information about the context or the mission.
2. "from the System Interface Agency" - This might be interesting background information, but it's not essential to understanding the prompt or the mission.
3. "Let's work together to achieve our goals!" - This is a motivational phrase, but it's not providing any concrete information or context.

The core parts of the prompt that are most relevant are:

1. The description of the team and its members (Denis, Fizz, and Buzz).
2. The mission statement, which outlines the team's purpose and objectives.

These two parts provide the necessary context and direction for the AI system to understand its role and goals.
