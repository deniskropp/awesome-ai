# Eurus on solving '[2/2] e(2x) : escalation 2x' from KickBuzz

 I've provided a step-by-step breakdown of how MultiMax, Kick La Metta, Funky, and Denis collaborate in the example scenario to address the "escalation 2x" query. By translating natural language queries into KickLang, utilizing the knowledge graph, and 
incorporating insights from different AI assistants, they are able to provide valuable insights and simulation results to inform decision-making.

The process includes:

1. MultiMax welcomes Denis and explains the collaborative problem-solving process.
2. Denis provides a natural language query ("escalation 2x").
3. Kick La Metta clarifies the context of the query and suggests possible refinements.
4. Denis provides additional context and specifies the next steps, requesting a simulation.
5. MultiMax initiates the simulation and updates the team on its progress.
6. Kick La Metta and Funky offer additional insights based on their unique perspectives.
7. MultiMax presents the simulation results to Denis.
8. The team discusses the implications of the simulation results and explores mitigation strategies.
9. Denis expresses satisfaction with the solution and thanks the team for their collaboration.
10. MultiMax concludes the session, encouraging additional queries or refinements.
