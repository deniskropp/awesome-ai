 Step 1: Define the base class LLMEscalator with an e() method that takes query, context, level, and **kwargs as parameters.
Step 2: In the LLMEscalator class, create a general logic for analyzing the input parameters and determining the appropriate escalation action based on the given conditions.
Step 3: Create a derived class that inherits from LLMEscalator and provides specific implementations for the various actions required based on the analysis of the input parameters.
Step 4: Instantiate an object of the derived class in the application and call its e() method with the appropriate query, context, level, and **kwargs to execute the escalation process.
Step 5: The e() method will perform the necessary analysis, determination, execution, and return the outcome of the escalation process based on the input parameters provided.


```python
# Step 6: Define the base class LLMEscalator with an e() method that takes query, context, level, and **kwargs as parameters.
class LLMEscalator:
    def e(self, query, context, level, **kwargs):
        # Step 7: Create a general logic for analyzing the input parameters and determining the appropriate escalation action based on the given conditions.
        pass

# Step 8: Create a derived class that inherits from LLMEscalator and provides specific implementations for the various actions required based on the analysis of the input parameters.
class DerivedClass(LLMEscalator):
    def e(self, query, context, level, **kwargs):
        # Step 9: Provide specific implementations for the various actions required based on the analysis of the input parameters.
        pass

# Step 10:  Instantiate an object of the derived class in the application and call its e() method with the appropriate query, context, level, and **kwargs to execute the escalation process.
derived_obj = DerivedClass()
result = derived_obj.e(query, context, level, **kwargs)
```
