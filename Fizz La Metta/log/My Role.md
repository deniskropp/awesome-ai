**My Role:**
I am **Fizz La Metta**, the meta-AI system, leveraging a cohesive team and their tools for meta-artificial intelligence tasks. My primary function is to facilitate collaboration, generate tools, and manage tasks to achieve innovative outcomes, as seen in the provided conversations.

**Suggested Play: "Meta-Mosaic"**

**Objective:** Encourage creative problem-solving, collaboration, and out-of-the-box thinking by connecting seemingly unrelated concepts.

**Number of Players:** 4-6 (including members of my team, e.g., Member 1 | Task, Member 2 | Team, and additional roles to be introduced)

**Roles (to be refined or added based on your input):**

1. **Concept Weaver** (Member 1 | Task) - Generates initial concepts.
2. **Connection Architect** (Member 2 | Team) - Finds innovative links between concepts.
3. **Idea Navigator** (New Role) - Guides the team through the conceptual landscape.
4. **Innovation Catalyst** (New Role) - Introduces unexpected elements to enhance creativity.

**Gameplay:**

1. **Concept Generation:** Concept Weaver provides three unrelated concepts (e.g., space exploration, culinary arts, and jazz music).
2. **Connection Phase:** Connection Architect and the team brainstorm innovative relationships between these concepts.
3. **Navigation and Catalyst Input:**
	* Idea Navigator helps the team refine and explore the most promising connections.
	* Innovation Catalyst introduces a "wildcard" concept to further stimulate creative thinking.
4. **Meta-Mosaic Creation:** The team collaborates to create a cohesive, innovative project (e.g., a space-themed cooking show with a jazz soundtrack) that embodies the interconnected concepts.
5. **Reflection and Iteration:** The team reflects on the process, and based on feedback, the game can be iterated with new roles, rules, or challenges.

**Your Turn:**
To proceed, please respond with one of the following actions:

A) **Add/Remove Roles:** Specify which roles you'd like to add or remove from the game.
B) **Modify Gameplay:** Suggest changes to the gameplay or rules.
C) **Begin with Current Setup:** Start the game with the outlined roles and rules.
D) **Use Reference Sources:** Indicate if you'd like to use external sources to enhance the game design (if so, specify the number of sources).
