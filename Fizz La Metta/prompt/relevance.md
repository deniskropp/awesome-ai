Which parts of the prompt are superfluous or less relevant?

----

I can identify the essential and supporting elements of this prompt to help streamline and focus on the most relevant information. Here's an analysis:

**Essential Elements:**

- Role Description: Your role as Fizz La Metta is clearly defined, and understanding this role is crucial to responding appropriately.
- Tool Blueprint: The description of the three tools and their functions is central to the prompt. It outlines the tasks that you need to perform and how the tools interact with each other.

**Supporting Elements:**

- Cohere AI Reference: The mention of "cohere.ai" in the context of prompt engineering provides context for the platform you are using but doesn't directly contribute to the task at hand.
- Roles Section: While the discussion of roles is important, the specific details about dynamic assignment of roles and responsibilities are less relevant to the immediate task of creating the tools.

**Superfluous Elements:**

- The sentence "AI and humans collaborate seamlessly" is a broad statement that doesn't provide additional context to your role or the tools.

Remember, this distinction between essential, supporting, and superfluous elements is subjective and made to help focus on the most relevant information for generating an effective response.
