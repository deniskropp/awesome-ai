# Escalate a query or task based on context and level, using configured actions.

## Step 1: Understand the high-level design and purpose of the e() function in the large language model (LLM) architecture.
## Step 2: The e() function serves as an interface for managing complex scenarios and enhancing the robustness and reliability of the LLM architecture.
## Step 3: The function takes self, query, context (optional), level, and **kwargs as input parameters.
## Step 4: Query and context are used to analyze the nature and urgency of the escalation.
## Step 5: Level indicates the escalation level, and **kwargs allows for passing additional keyword arguments.
## Step 6: The function analyzes the provided query and context, determines the most appropriate action based on this analysis, executes the chosen escalation action, and returns a response indicating theoutcome of the escalation process.
## Step 7: If the escalation level is greater than 0, the e() function recursively calls itself with an increased escalation level.


# Step 8: The __init__ method initializes the LLM object with required parameters.
# Instead of directly assigning the escalation_actions to an instance variable, it's better to validate and initialize it.
# This allows us to add any necessary checks or transformations to the escalation_actions before using them.

# The `run_query` function takes a user's query as input and uses an e()-augmented LLM architecture to analyze the query.

The function returns the final response to the query and the escalation path, which is a list of LLMs that were used to escalate the query.

# Here's how the function works:
#
# 1. It initializes the escalation path with the core LLM model and sets an initial threshold for confidence.
# 2. The function generates a response from the core LLM model using the `generate_response` method of the core LLM object. This method returns a response object that includes the generated text and a confidence score.
# 3. If the confidence score is below the threshold, the function enters a while loop to escalate the query.
# 4. Inside the loop, the function adjusts the threshold based on the query and the current escalation path using the `threshold_adjustment_function`. This allows for dynamic adjustments of the threshold as the query is analyzed by different LLMs.
# 5. The function then selects the most appropriate outer LLM model based on the query and the current escalation path using the `select_outer_llm` function. This function is not shown in the provided code, so its implementation is assumed to be outside of this scope.
# 6. The selected outer LLM model generates a response for the query using its `generate_response` method.
# 7. The confidence score of the outer LLM's response is compared with the threshold. If it is still below the threshold, the loop continues and another outer LLM is selected for analysis.
# 8. Once the confidence score meets or exceeds the threshold, the function exits the loop and returns the final response and the escalation path.

"""
Sure, I'd be happy to explain the e()-augmented LLM architecture in the context you've provided.

The e()-augmented LLM architecture is a system that uses a core LLM model (Large Language Model) and a set of outer LLM models. The core LLM model is the primary model that generates initial responses. If the confidence score of the core LLM's response is below a certain threshold, the query is then escalated to one or more outer LLM models. These outer LLM models are specialized in different domains and are used to provide more accurate or detailed responses when the core LLM's confidence is low.

The architecture is named "e()-augmented" because it uses an escalation function (e()) to determine when to use the outer LLM models. This function is not explicitly defined in the provided context, but it's assumed to be a mechanism that adjusts the threshold for confidence based on the query and the current escalation path. This allows for dynamic adjustments of the threshold as the query is analyzed by different LLMs.

The outer LLM models are selected based on the query and the current escalation path. The specific method for selecting these models is not shown in the provided code, so its implementation is assumed to be outside of this scope.

The system continues to escalate the query to outer LLM models until the confidence score meets or exceeds the threshold, at which point the final response and the escalation path (the list of LLMs that were used to analyze the query) are returned.
