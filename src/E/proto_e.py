## In the context of designing a Large Language Model (LLM) system, develop a step-by-step plan for creating a prototype with a minimal e() function and a single inner LLM. The system should effectively process basic tasks and escalate queries when the inner LLM encounters uncertainty or limitations. Make sure the plan covers key aspects of prototype development, such as:

def e(self, query, context=None, level, **kwargs):
    """
    The e() function is an important part of a large language model (LLM) architecture that helps the LLM escalate queries or tasks when it encounters limitations, uncertainty, or requires 
    external intervention. It analyzes the input query, context, and escalation level to determine and execute the most appropriate action, such as triggering external tools, logging events, or seeking human 
    assistance. By incorporating this function, the LLM can more effectively handle complex reasoning, access external knowledge sources, and manage errors.

    The e() function takes self, query, context (optional), level, and **kwargs as input parameters. It follows these general steps:
    1. Analyze the provided query, context, and level to understand the nature and urgency of the escalation.
    2. Determine the most appropriate action to take based on this analysis. Potential actions include triggering an external API call, logging the escalation event, requesting human intervention, or 
    generating a warning message.
    3. Execute the chosen escalation action.
    4. Return a response indicating the outcome of the escalation process.

    By incorporating the e() function, the layered LLM architecture can more effectively handle complex or challenging scenarios, improving its overall robustness and reliability in real-world applications. 
    This function acts as a key interface between the LLM's internal capabilities and external resources or human oversight, enhancing the model's ability to adapt and respond to diverse situations.
